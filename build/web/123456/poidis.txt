//Poisson distribution
//Fitting poisson distribution and finding theoretical frequency
//step 1 find mean for given x(i) and f(i)
//step 2 find probability for p(x=x(i))
//step 3 multiply the probability with the corresponding frequency p(x-x(i)) * f(i)
//the result of step 3 is the Theoretical frequency display it
